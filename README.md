This repository contains implementation of multiple models on sentiment data gathered from twitter.

# Datasets Used: 
1. Sentiment140 for text based classification. You can [download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) it from here.
2. MVSA Enriched for text and image classification. You can You can [download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dunyajasim/twitter-dataset-for-sentiment-analysis) it from here.

# Unimodal modeling:
1. VADER (Lexicon Based)- Executed on Colab
2. LSTM- Executed on VsCode
3. LSTM + VADER Hybrid- Executed on VsCode

# Multimodal modeling:
BERT+ResNet50 fused with attention layer: Executed on Kaggle notebook 

I'll add the detailed pipeline for every model later. :)
